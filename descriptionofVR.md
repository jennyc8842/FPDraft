## Overview of Virtual Reality
---

Virtual Reality is a technology that allows users to interact with others in a 3 dimensional world.
  The VR sets are usually mostly distributed in Europe and North America.
    Virtual Reality was created by Ivan Sutherland, a computer scientist and his student Bob Sproull.
      They first created a mount display that was made in 1968. This device was huge and heavy compared to what we have today.

The past VR sets were mostly uncomfortable to wear. Virtual Reality is important because it preps for actual changes people want to do, such as if they want a practice run before the real test.
  It can help them to practice skills people want to learn.
    In addition, virtual reality also helps people interact with others if they have social problems.
      Virtual Reality started off as a device for an engaging theatre experience that was invented in 1957 and from there on, virtual reality kept on advancing.

As of today, we are continuing to make VR sets that can be wore more comfortably and engages players to have a smooth experience with it.
  Hopefully, one day we will be able to use these for not just for entertainment and educational purposes, but for other purposes as well.
